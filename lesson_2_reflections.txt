What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a directory called .git which is important metadata to keep track of the changes made between versions

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Allow you to get more control on files in each version by leaving files in working directory and adding files to commit them
